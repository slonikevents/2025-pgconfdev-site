    # Code of Conduct

    PGConf.dev is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience
    for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in
    any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference
    venue, including talks.

    Conference participants violating this policy may be sanctioned or expelled
    from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the Code Of
    Conduct committee.

    Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual
    orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, religion, sexual images
    in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing,
    photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
    inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants
    asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
    Failure to comply will result in sanctions and/or ejection from the
    conference without a refund.

    If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers
    will work with the Code Of Conduct Committee to decide what action to take,
    including but not limited to: warning the offender, expulsion from the
    conference with no refund, and/or referral to appropriate authorities. If
    you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have
    any other concerns, please contact a member of the conference staff,
    including anyone on the conference committee, or the Code of Conduct
    committee, immediately.

    Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security
    or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those
    experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We
    value your attendance. Decisions regarding appropriate assistance will be at
    the sole discretion of the conference committee.
